# ngods stock market demo 
This repository contains a stock market analysis demo of the ngods data stack. The demo performs the following steps:

1. Download selected stock symbols data from [Yahoo Finance API](https://finance.yahoo.com/).
2. Store the stock data in ngods data warehouse (using [Iceberg](https://iceberg.apache.org/) format).
3. Transform the data (e.g. normalize stock prices) using [dbt](https://www.getdbt.com/).
4. Expose analytics data model using [cube.dev](https://cube.dev/).
5. Visualize data as reports and dashboards using [Metabase](https://www.metabase.com/).
6. Predicts stock prices using ARIMA in Apache Spark.

The demo is packaged as [docker-compose](https://github.com/docker/compose) script that downloads, installs, and runs all components of the data stack.

![ngods components](./img/ngods.architecture.png)

ngods is open-sourced under a [BSD license](https://github.com/zsvoboda/ngods-stocks/blob/main/LICENSE) and it is distributed as a docker-compose script that supports Intel and ARM architectures.

# Running the demo
ngods requires a machine with at least 16GB RAM and Intel or Arm 64 CPU running [Docker](https://www.docker.com/). It requires [docker-compose](https://github.com/docker/compose).

1. Clone the [ngods repo](https://github.com/zsvoboda/ngods-stocks)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zsvoboda/ngods-stocks.git
```

2. Start the data stack with the `docker-compose up` command

```bash
cd ngods-stocks

docker-compose up -d
```

**NOTE:** This can take quite long depending on your network speed.

3. Stop the data stack via the `docker-compose down` command

```bash
docker-compose down
```

4. Execute the data pipeline from the Dagster console at http://localhost:3070/ with [this yaml config file](./projects/dagster/e2e.yaml).

![Dagster e2e](./img/demo/dagster.e2e.png)

Cut and paste the content of the [e2e.yaml file](./projects/dagster/e2e.yaml) to this [Dagster UI console page](http://localhost:3070/workspace/workspace@workspace.py/jobs/e2e/playground) and start the data pipeline by clicking the `Launch Run` button. 

**NOTE:** You can customize the list of stock symbols that will be downloaded. 

5. Review and customize the [cube.dev metrics, and dimensions](./conf/cube/schema/). Test these metrics in the [cube.dev playground](http://localhost:4000/#/build?query={%22measures%22:[%22StockMarketsMonthly.price_close_relative_avg%22],%22timeDimensions%22:[{%22dimension%22:%22StockMarketsMonthly.dt%22,%22granularity%22:%22month%22,%22dateRange%22:[%222014-09-01%22,%222022-07-03%22]}],%22dimensions%22:[%22StockMarketsMonthly.symbol%22],%22filters%22:[{%22member%22:%22StockMarketsMonthly.symbol%22,%22operator%22:%22equals%22,%22values%22:[%22AAPL%22,%22GC=F%22,%22BTC-USD%22]}],%22order%22:[[%22StockMarketsMonthly.symbol%22,%22asc%22],[%22StockMarketsMonthly.dt%22,%22desc%22]]}).

## ngods databases: Spark, Trino, and Postgres
ngods stack includes three database engines: Spark, Trino, and Postgres. Both Spark and Trino have access to Iceberg tables in `warehouse.bronze` and `warehouse.silver` schemas. Trino engine can also access the `analytics.gold` schema in Postgres. Trino can federate queries between the Postgres and Iceberg tables. 

The Spark engine is configured for ELT and pyspark data transformations. 

![Spark](./img/spark.schemas.png)

The Trino engine is configured for data federation between the Iceberg and Postgres tables. Additional catalogs can be [configured](./conf/trino/catalog) as needed. 

![Trino](./img/trino.schemas.png)

The Postgres database has accesses only to the `analytics.gold` schema and it is used for executing analytical queries over the gold data.

## Demo data pipeline
The demo data pipeline is utilizes the [medallion architecture](https://databricks.com/fr/glossary/medallion-architecture) with `bronze`, `silver`, and `gold` data stages. 


![data pipeline](./img/data.pipeline.png)

and consists of the following phases:

1. Data are downloaded from Yahoo Finance REST API to the local Minio bucket ([./data/stage](./data/stage)) using this [Dagster operation](./projects/dagster/download.py).
2. The downloaded CSV file is loaded to the bronze stage Iceberg tables (warehouse.bronze Spark schema) using dbt models that are executed in Spark ([./projects/dbt/bronze](./projects/dbt/bronze/models/in_yahoo_finance.sql)).
3. Silver stage Iceberg tables (warehouse.silver Spark schema) are created using dbt models that are executed in Spark ([./projects/dbt/silver](./projects/dbt/silver/models/stock_markets_with_relative_prices.sql)). 
5. Gold stage Postgres tables (analytics.gold Trino schema) are created using dbt models that are executed in Trino ([./projects/dbt/gold](./projects/dbt/gold/models/stock_markets.sql)).

![DBT models](./img/dbt.models.png)

All data pipeline phases are orchestrated by [Dagster](https://www.dagster.io/) framework. Dagster operations, resources and jobs are defined in the [Dagster project](./projects/dagster/). 

![Dagster console](./img/dagster.console.png)

The pipeline is executed by running the e2e job from the Dagster console at http://localhost:3070/ using [this yaml config file](./projects/dagster/e2e.yaml)

## ngods analytics layer
ngods includes [cube.dev](https://cube.dev/) for [semantic data model](./conf/cube/schema) and [Metabase](https://www.metabase.com/) for self-service analytics (dashboards, reports, and visualizations).

![Analytics](./img/analytics.png)

Analytical (semantic) model is defined in [cube.dev](https://cube.dev/) and is used for executing analytical queries over the gold data.

![cube.dev](./img/cube.png)

[Metabase](https://www.metabase.com/) is connected to the [cube.dev](https://cube.dev/) via [SQL API](https://cube.dev/docs/backend/sql). End users can use it for self-service creation of dashboards, reports, and data visualizations. [Metabase](https://www.metabase.com/) is also directly connected to the gold schema in the Postgres database.

![Metabase](./img/demo/metabase.cube.connection.png)

## ngods machine learning
[Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) with Scala, Java and Python backends can be used for machine learning.
